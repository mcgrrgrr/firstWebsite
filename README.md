My first Website

## I am pretty sure this heading will be smaller

Todo List:

-[x] Find original version of this file
-[x] Add that repo to your github
-[x] Finish this section
-[x] Study the way of the Master Programmer

## This is the second and final time that I will recreate this repo

This first time I tried, I didn't know how to type yet. Had to start at 
the very beginning to truly be able to do this with any amount of 
confidence.

I wonder how many times I will end up rewriting this README before I end
up deleting it, renaming it, or recreating it. 

I will maintain it for as long as possible, if only to see how long it 
lasts, what it becomes, and whether or not it takes on a life of its own.
